Design Description

Process:
I found this project quite challenging. I had an idea of how I wanted to structure the 
game and spent a number of days coding everything out, only to realize I couldn't get 
turtle to perform an action that I based the whole thing on. Thankfully, I figured out a 
different solution and was able to code out the rest. I think creating a Game class was 
particularly helpful because I was able to update and pass around values without needing 
global variables. I did end up using a Constants file because there were a variety of 
numbers that needed to be exact and I didn't want to have a bunch of magic numbers in my 
code.
Mostly, I'm just so relieved the game works! 

Refactoring:
I'd like to shrink some of my methods. In particular the "clicker" method seems long. I do
tend to have specific variable names, so sometimes it makes my functions look longer than 
they really are, but I feel like there must be a simpler way. Also, I'd love to add a 
"Start a New Game" feature, so a player doesn't exit out of the game each time.

Testing:
For my testing file, since many of my functions automatically update the turtle screen and
don't have any output, I was only able to test the secret vs player guess function. I 
actually added the inputs and output in my mastermind_game.py file specifically to be able
to run tests with the function. I also decided to have 4 tests to show that the function
worked both of mixed result responses, and for entirely correct responses.
I did include the init/constructor test, just to make sure the info from creating a new 
instance of the Game class, correctly placed everything in the correct attribute.
